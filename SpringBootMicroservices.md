**Monolith vs Microservices**

- Monolith
  - everything is in one code
  - no issues that come with microservices scalability

- Microservices
 - Solving scalability issues
 - Solving modularity issues (deploy individual services)
 - Make sure microservices can scale

With microservices problems you are trying to solve are generic and most likely there are solutions for them - load balancing, distributed cache.

You are solving issues between microservices, not within microservices.

**Microservice vs webservice**

- Microservice is a specific service within a solution
- Webservice (SOA) is general purpose service that other services can use
